# blue-archive-spine
Based on [respectZ/blue-archive-spine](https://github.com/respectZ/blue-archive-spine)

## Quick Start
* Use this template
* Create `jp` and `global` branch from `resourceless`
* Enable GitHub Actions, manually trigger `Update-Global` and `Update-JP` at any branch (they will find the right branch, no matter where you trigger them) to get the first update
* `Update-Global` will run daily and fails when no update is available, `Update-JP` won't run automatically

`Update-JP` Needs to be triggered manually since there isn't a solution to get the latest update json link automatically. `ba_api` in `getModelsJapan.py` needs to be updated manually (through reverse engineering or network capture) when there is a new update.

## About Japan version
The update json link seems to be hard coded into the game code.

We can get `LatestClientVersion` from `https://prod-noticeindex.bluearchiveyostar.com/prod/index.json`, but how the random hash path (likes `r48_2q1alt6gvk5igdsj4hl2.json`) under `yostar-serverinfo.bluearchiveyostar.com` is generated?

It seems that BA Japan (Yostar) does not have a certain resource path API. And their developers hard code the resource link for a version into the game code. The game only checks for `LatestClientVersion` to see if it's outdated and asks the user to update the game from Google Play to get the latest resource link.

Does this mean the user has to update the game from Google Play every month to get the latest monthly in-game activity? -- Yes, this is what's happening. (BA Japan releases an update at Google Play about every month, while BA Global updates about every three months)

## About this repo
This repo is a fork of [respectZ/blue-archive-spine](https://github.com/respectZ/blue-archive-spine). Some contributors and I modified the code to make it work better.

`blue-archive-spine` is a tool to download and view the character arts and animations (Memorial Lobby) of the game [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/home).

It's recommneded to use GitHub Actions to download the resources automatically. If you want to download the resources manually, please refer to the original README.

# Informations
For viewing Blue Archive Spines.

Have a look at [this branch](https://github.com/respectZ/blue-archive-spine/tree/resourceless) for resourceless.

# Requirements
- [decrunch](https://github.com/HearthSim/decrunch/)
- [fsb5](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-fsb5)
- [lz4](https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [astc_decomp](https://github.com/K0lb3/astc_decomp/)
- MSVC++ 14.0 Build Tools with Windows 10 SDK

# Setup
## Building UnityPack
```
setup.py build
```
## Installing UnityPack
```
setup.py install
```
or
```
setup.py install --user
```

# Downloading Models
```
py/getModels.py
```
Downloaded Models located at ./downloaded_resource

Assets (Spine and Audio) located at ./assets

# Generating JSON Data
## data/audio.json
```
py/generateAudioJson.py
```
This will download VOC_JP audio instead of playing it directly (cors issue ?)

To play audio directly from BA's server, change py/generateModelsJson.py
```python
_type = 1
```
to
```python
_type = 0
```
## data/models.json
```
py/generateModelsJson.py
```
## And you're done!
Just launch index.html
